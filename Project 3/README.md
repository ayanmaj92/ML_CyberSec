# Final Project: Predicting Vulnerability of Windows machines to Malware
This project is the final project of the course. The project is inspired by the Kaggle competition hosted by Microsoft on Malware Prediction.
The goal is to predict the vulnerability of PCs running on Windows to malware. Given a vast dataset of Windows machines and their specifications, we attempt to solve the task using various machine learning models.
The tasks completed:
*We perform initial exploratory data analysis of the given features. 
*We implement some feature engineering and data pre-processing.
*We explore multiple machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, LightGBM, neural networks.
*Perform extensive analysis of the outcomes.
